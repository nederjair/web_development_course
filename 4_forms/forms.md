# Forms

It didn’t take long for the web to shift from a network of pages to read to a place where you go to get things done—making purchases, booking plane tickets, signing petitions, searching a site, posting a tweet…the list goes on! Web forms handle all of these interactions.

In fact, in response to this shift from page to application, `HTML5` introduced a bonanza of new form controls and attributes that make it easier for users to fill out forms and for developers to create them. Tasks that have traditionally relied on `JavaScript` may be handled by markup and native browser behavior
alone. HTML5 introduces a number of new form-related elements, 12 new
input types, and many new attributes (they are listed in TABLE 9-1 at the end
of this chapter). Some of these features are waiting for browser implementa-
tion to catch up, so I will be sure to note which controls may not be univer-
sally supported.
