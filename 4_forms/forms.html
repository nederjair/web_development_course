    <h1>Forms</h1>
    <p>
      It didn’t take long for the web to shift from a network of pages to read
      to a place where you go to get things done—making purchases, booking plane
      tickets, signing petitions, searching a site, posting a tweet…the list
      goes on! Web forms handle all of these interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, in response to this shift from page to application,
      <span>HTML5</span>
      introduced a bonanza of new form controls and attributes that make it
      easier for users to fill out forms and for developers to create them.
      Tasks that have traditionally relied on `JavaScript` may be handled by
      markup and native browser behavior alone. HTML5 introduces a number of new
      form-related elements, 12 new input types, and many new attributes (they
      are listed in TABLE 9-1 at the end of this chapter). Some of these
      features are waiting for browser implementa- tion to catch up, so I will
      be sure to note which controls may not be univer- sally supported.

      This chapter introduces web forms, how they work, and the markup used to
      create them. I’ll also briefly discuss the importance of web form design.
