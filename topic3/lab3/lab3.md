# Laboratory work 3

Your task is to write the source document (html file) for the table shown in the `figure 1`.

**Figure 1**

1. First, make a copy of your root folder used in the previous laboratory work, name it `lab3`.

2. Open the just created `lab3` folder with vscode.

3. Create a new document in your vscode and set up its overall structure (`DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, `title`, and `body` elements). Save the document as `table.html` in the root folder.

4. Next, in order to make the boundaries of the cells and table clear when you check your work, I’m going to have you add some simple style sheet rules to the document. Don’t worry about understanding exactly what’s happening here (although it’s fairly intuitive); just insert this style element in the head of the document exactly as you see it here:

```html
<head>
<title> Lab3 Tables</title>
<style>
td, th { border: 1px solid #CCC; }
table { border: 1px solid black; }
</style>
</head>
```

<div class="page-break" style="page-break-before: always;"></div>
