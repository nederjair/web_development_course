# Tables
After covering how to establish the basic structure of an HTML document, how to mark up text to give it meaning and structure, how to make links, and how to embed simple images on the page we will study how to markup tables. We’ll start out by reviewing how tables should be used, then learn the elements used to create them. Remember, this is all about semantic markup, so we’re going to focus on the markup that structures the content into tables, and we won’t be concerned with how the tables look.

## HOW TO USE TABLES
HTML tables were created for instances when you need to add tabular material (data arranged into rows and columns) to a web page. Tables may be used to organize schedules, product comparisons, statistics, or other types of information. Note that “data” doesn’t necessarily mean numbers. A table cell may contain any sort of information, including numbers, text elements, and even images and multimedia objects.

In visual browsers, the arrangement of data in rows and columns gives readers an instant understanding of the relationships between data cells and their respective header labels. In this, lecture we will focus on HTML table elements used to semantically mark up rows and columns of data as described in the HTML specification.
